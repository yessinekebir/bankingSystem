# Banking Transfer System
Simulating a banking system using Client - Server architecture.
The project was started for the backend exam . 
API integrated: 
- Register a banking account (name,surname,country,email,password,IBAN, balance) #
  - IBAN it's generated by a function (developed by me) , that takes country in input and generate a string (series of ***characters*** starting with the two first letter of the country) 

- Login
- Send money (IBAN and amount *required* )
- Show all transactions
*Filter and show transactions by query*
- Show sent transactions
- Show received transactions
